Business Domain Chosen: Transportation & Logistics

For this assignment, the chosen business domain is Transportation and Logistics, specifically focusing on ride demand and operational efficiency analysis.
This sector plays a crucial role in modern urban mobility, where companies like Uber continuously optimize routes, driver allocation, and customer experience. The logistics industry depends heavily on data to improve delivery speed, minimize idle times, and reduce costs. Analyzing such datasets enables companies to understand real-time demand fluctuations, customer behavior, and route performance, which are critical for achieving business efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the Uber Pickups Dataset, available publicly on Kaggle.

Dataset Link:
Uber Pickups in New York City (Kaggle)

This dataset contains records of Uber rides and pickup patterns across New York City during 2014, originally published by FiveThirtyEight for transportation analysis research.

Brief Description of the Raw Data

The dataset contains detailed information about individual Uber trips, including:

START_DATE and END_DATE – Timestamps showing when and where each trip began and ended.

CATEGORY – Indicates whether the trip was Business or Personal.

START and STOP – Names of the pickup and drop-off locations.

MILES – Total distance traveled during the trip.

PURPOSE – The reason for travel, such as Meeting, Customer Visit, Errand, etc.

It originally contained over 1,100 records, some with missing purposes and slight inconsistencies in location naming and timestamp formats. These issues were systematically cleaned and preprocessed to prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis.

Business Questions to Answer

The objective of this analysis is to uncover operational insights that can enhance decision-making for a logistics or ride-sharing company.
Key questions explored include:

When does peak demand occur?
Identify the hours and days with the highest ride activity to optimize driver scheduling.

Which locations have the highest pickup frequency?
Helps in planning regional resource allocation and identifying underserved zones.

How do weekdays and weekends differ in ride patterns?
Supports targeted deployment for corporate vs. leisure routes.

What is the relationship between trip distance and duration?
Reveals route efficiency and potential optimization areas.

What are the most common purposes of rides?
Aids in developing customer segmentation and business-oriented service models.

Conclusion

By analyzing Uber trip data, this project aims to extract actionable insights that mirror real-world logistics operations. The results of this study will help transportation companies improve route planning, enhance fleet utilization, and reduce operational inefficiencies—ultimately driving better customer satisfaction and business growth.
